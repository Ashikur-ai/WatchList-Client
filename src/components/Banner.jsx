                                <p className="mb-5">Pathans in India are citizens or residents of India who are of ethnic Pashtun(Afghan) ancestry. "Pathan" is the local Hindi-Urdu term for an individual who belongs to the Pashtun ethnic group, or descends from it.[6][7] The term additionally finds mention among Western sources, mainly in the colonial-era literature of British India.[8][9] Historically, the term "Afghan" was also synonymous with the Pathans.[10] The Pathans originate from the Pashtunistan region that straddles Afghanistan and North West Pakistan.[11][12]

                                    There are varying estimates of the population of Pathan descent living in India, ranging from 3.2 million people per the All India Pakhtoon Jirga-e-Hind[1][2][3] to "twice their population in Afghanistan" as per Khan Mohammad Atif, an academic at the University of Lucknow.[13] In the 2011 Census of India, 21,677 individuals reported Pashto as their mother tongue.[4]</p>
